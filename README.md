# time-deconvolution
This codebase is a collection of methods to implement analytical inversions of one-sided or causal time convolution with a known kernel. These methods are broadly applicable to the inversion of Volterra equations of the first, second, or integro-differential type both in continuous and discrete time and treat their inversion in a unified manner.
